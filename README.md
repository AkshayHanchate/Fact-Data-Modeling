### Fact Data Modeling 
Welcome to the Fact Data Modeling repository! This repository is a part of my learning journey from the Zach Wilson Data Engineering Bootcamp, where we dive deep into the concepts and best practices of data modeling for analytical systems. The goal of this repository is to document and share knowledge on fact data modeling, including advanced techniques for handling complex data structures.

**üìö What You‚Äôll Find Here:**
This repository contains the following key concepts and examples:
**1. Fact Data Modeling Basics:**
Overview of Fact Tables: Key metrics and measures for analysis.
Understanding the role of Dimensions in supporting facts.

**2. Advanced Techniques**
- Datelist Data Structure:
Explores how to model and manage date-based dimensions efficiently.
Use cases in time-series analysis and periodic data aggregation.
- Blurring Lines Between Facts and Dimensions:
Insights into hybrid models where traditional distinctions between facts and dimensions are minimized.
Practical examples of mixed-use cases.
- Reducing Shuffle with Reduced Facts:
Techniques to minimize shuffle in distributed systems.
Optimizing fact tables for faster queries and reduced computational overhead.


**üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:**
The following tools and technologies are used throughout the exercises:

- SQL: To define and query data models.
- Apache Spark: For distributed data processing.
- Databricks: Collaborative environment for scalable data engineering tasks.


**üöÄ Topics Covered:**
- Data modeling principles with a focus on analytical systems.
- Techniques for optimizing fact tables and their interactions with dimensions.
- Best practices for handling large-scale datasets in distributed environments.
- Real-world examples and hands-on exercises.
